SFTP using reliable UDP
 *Protocol used UDP
 *Reliablity provided by GBN and ARQ

UDP Client
 * Sends data packets
 * Input
   @ param FileName - name of the file to send
   @ param MSS - the maximum number of data bytes in a segment, exclude header
   @ param N - the number of segments(data + header) that can be sent without receiving an ACK
 * rdt_send()
   Reads data from a file on a byte by byte basis and makes a packet that is atmost 1MSS
   before sending it.
 
UDP Server
 * Listens of port 7735
 * Implements receiver side of GBN
 * Recives data packets
 * Sends ACK for packets without error, else does nothing
 
 
Data Packet
 * Header
   - 32 bit sequenece number
     - Sequence Numbers Start from 0
   - 16 bit checksum, computed the same as UDP checksum
   - 16-bit field that has the value 0101010101010101, indicating that this is a data packet.
   
ACK packet
  * Header
    - 32 bit sequence number
      - Sequence number will be of the packet to be received at the receiver
    - 16 bit field all zeros
    - 16-bit field that has the value 1010101010101010, indicating that this is an ACK packet. 

Error Generation
  * @param p - loss probability
  * @param r - random number
  * if r <= p packet is discarded at server to simulate loss, otherwise accepted.
